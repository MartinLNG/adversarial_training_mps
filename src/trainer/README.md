In this module, the different trainers for the `BornMachine` are implemented, which includes vanilla classification training, adversarial training, and GAN-style training. Training of the discriminator, which is needed for GAN-style training, is implemented as a method of its class. 

These trainers can be composed together, depending on the training scheme used.
